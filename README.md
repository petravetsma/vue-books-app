# Front end Engineer Challenge


## 1. About you

> Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js or AngularJS.

I have realized from scratch a large highly-scalable front app for the management of education in Scandinavian countries. 
We were working in a team of 3 front-end developers and were using Vue.js TypeScript Nuxt.js Vuex Vite.

## 2. General

##### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?

I am a team player and prefer to work in a team. 
I am interested in impactful and useful business domains such as fintech in ed-tech. 
Also, prefer to work with professionals tune my skills, and make high-quality product.

##### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?

Semantic html tags (header, footer, main, article, etc)
Expanded <input/> tags (email, month, number, etc)

Use them very often in my daily tasks.

##### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting `innerHTML` and using `createElement`.

Creating a new element and appending it to DOM with createElement provide better performance and security.

##### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.

In one-way data flow, the View does not update automatically when the data Model changes, so we need to add custom code to update/trigger it when the data model is changed
In two-way data binding, View automatically updates when the data Model is changed

##### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?

In Front-end.
Because of the way current web browsers are built for handling many users I/O operations with event loop we have to right asynchronous code.
